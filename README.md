# Fibonacci_Sequence_Assessment
This is an application is buiult by .Net 5.0.

## Application description
This app consists of a REST API project, a frontend directory under src directory that includes files for front-end part of the assessment and a test project which is developed by NUnit for unit testing the app.
I used Sql Server,EF and repository in order to save histories of requests.
Also this app is dockerized by docker-compose.
When run this app, Swagger url is shown at first.
Unfortunatly the front-end part doesn't work properly, because of Cors issue and I didn't spend much time to fix it.
